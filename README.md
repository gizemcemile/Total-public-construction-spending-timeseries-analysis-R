# Total-public-construction-spending-timeseries-analysis-R
The project dataset is downloaded from fred.stlouisfed.org. This data provides information about monthly estimates of the total dollar value of construction in the U.S from 2002 to 2019. As cited in Census.gov, data estimates include the cost of labor and materials, cost of architectural and engineering work, overhead costs, interest and taxes paid during construction, and contractorâ€™s profits. A million dollars define units of the value of spending. The project aims that develop a time series analysis using total public construction spendings information and offer an efficient model to use for generating future expenses.
